# PandorasBox
Pandora'sBox is a mod of Beepbox that adds built-in samples via chip waves. It was made by Blue Cat Productions (although Main figured out how to import samples in the first place).

# Requesting Samples
Sample requests are closed for now as custom samples are being worked on.
Currently, there are two beta version; both allow you to upload custom samples. The beepbox beta can be viewed [here](https://pandoras-box.thurm64.repl.co/index.html), while the jummbox beta can be seen [here](https://pandoras-box.thurm64.repl.co/pandoras-jummbox.html).

# PandorasBox
Pandoras'Box is a mod of Beepbox that adds built-in samples via chip waves. It was made by Blue Cat Productions (although Main figured out how to import samples in the first place).

# Requesting Samples
Sample requests are closed for now as custom samples are being worked on. View the beta version that allows you to upload custom samples [here](https://pandoras-box.thurm64.repl.co/index.html).

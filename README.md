# Pandora'sBox
Pandora'sBox is a mod of Beepbox that adds built-in samples via chip waves. It was made as a collaboration between Main Character of the Problem and Blue Cat Productions (Main figured out how to import samples in the first place and spread information about the mod, and Blue Cat made a mod out of samples and fixed some issues relating to them).

# Chippy Couch Discord Server and Requesting Samples
Sample requests for Pandora'sBox can be spoken on the Chippy Couch Discord Server (link below). We may not be able to add every sample within a timely manner. If you'd like, you can create your own Beepbox mod that adds samples (tutorial also below).

# Pandoraasbox
PandoraasBox is a mod of Beepbox that adds built-in samples via chip waves. It was made by Blue Cat Productions (although Main figured out how to import samples in the first place).

# Requesting Samples
We are currently making a fork or Pandoraasbox for new samples. However, bugs related to the number of chip waves get in the way of finishing this fork.
While you could make suggestions in #modded-beepbox channel of the Beepbox Discord, we recommend you use the offline version of Blubox instead.

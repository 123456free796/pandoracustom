# Pandora'sBox
Pandora's Box is a mod of Beepbox that adds built-in samples via chip waves. It was made as a collaboration between Main Character of the Problem and Blue Cat Productions (Main figured out how to import samples in the first place and spread information about the mod, and Blue Cat made a mod out of samples and fixed some issues relating to them).

# Requesting Samples
Sample requests are closed for now as custom samples are being worked on.
